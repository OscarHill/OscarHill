### Welcome to my Github!

This is my personal GitHub for personal projects, coding demonstrations, and learning. Most of my code will be in Python notebooks, though I do also have a demo website that I wrote in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Feel free to browse around!

#### About me
- I'm a Consultant Data Engineer currently employed by Sparta Global. I graduated from Manchester with an MA in Sociology, and before that I did my BA in Psychological and Behavioural Sciences at Cambridge.
- I'm very interested in machine learning, and have a number of machine learning projects and demos here on my GitHub.
- In the future, I'm planning to pursue postgraduate study in machine learning and artificial intelligence - either a Master's and then a PhD, or straight into PhD.
- Currently working my way through the SQL 50 on Leetcode!
- I also love music, chess, language learning, and video games - keep an eye out for any future projects there!
